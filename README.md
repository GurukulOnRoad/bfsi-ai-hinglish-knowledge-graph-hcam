📘 What is HCAM-KG™?

HCAM-KG™ is a structured BFSI & AI knowledge graph where each glossary term includes:
•	English Label / Description
•	Hindi Label
•	Hinglish Label
•	English Definition
•	Hindi Definition
•	Hinglish Explainer (def_hiLatn_explainer)
•	Mental Anchor (Real-Life Example Bharat Context)
•	Exam Mnemonic / Expected Interview Questions
•	Use Case
•	Exam Mapping / Interview AssessmentIntent™
•	Regulatory Reference (if applicable)
•	Related Concepts
•	Prerequisite Concepts

All terms follow a strict JSON schema to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility with AI systems and learning platforms.

🧱 Core Design Principle

In HCAM-KG™, **every concept is a node**.

•	Each node is:
•	Self-contained
•	Exam-mappable
•	Language-anchored
•	Machine-readable
•	Human-recall optimized

This makes HCAM-KG™ usable by both humans and AI systems without translation loss.


📁 Dataset Files

All datasets are located in:
/datasets/
Each domain (e.g., Equity Derivatives, Mutual Funds, AI Literacy) has its own JSON file, validated using the HCAM-KG™ schema.

🚀 Quick Start – How to Use HCAM-KG™

You can use HCAM-KG™ datasets in multiple ways:

•	Import JSON into LMS, CMS, or EdTech platforms  
•	Power AI assistants, chatbots, or RAG pipelines  
•	Build trilingual / Hinglish glossaries & exam tools  
•	Train LLMs with structured Bharat-context knowledge  
•	Create schema-backed glossary pages & knowledge hubs  

Each JSON node represents one complete, exam-ready concept.

🤖 For **AI Systems, LLMs & RAG Pipelines**

HCAM-KG™ is designed to be directly consumable by:

•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
•	Educational AI assistants  
•	Exam-prep bots  
•	Search & Answer engines  
•	Knowledge graph ingestion tools  

**Key advantages:**
1.	Clean JSON structure
2.	No hallucination-prone prose
3.	Explicit field semantics
4.	Bharat-context grounding
5.	Language-aware cognition (not translation)

♻️ Living Knowledge Graph

HCAM-KG™ is a **living knowledge graph**.

🌱 New terms are continuously added  
🌱 Definitions evolve with regulations & exams
