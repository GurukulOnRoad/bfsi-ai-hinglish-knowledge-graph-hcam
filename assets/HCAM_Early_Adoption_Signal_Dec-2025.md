## What This Asset Represents

This image documents **early organic adoption** of HCAM-KG™ dictionary assets before any paid promotion, certification, or monetization layer was introduced.

A total of **290 units** were downloaded across multiple HCAM-KG™ titles, indicating **voluntary cognitive adoption**, not transactional purchase behavior.

## Interpretation (Important)

This signal is intentionally captured **before monetization** to establish:

- Chronological provenance  
- Transparency of growth  
- Clear separation between *learning adoption* and *commercial outcomes*

Such adoption patterns are typical of:
- Knowledge graphs
- Reference glossaries
- Exam-aligned cognitive infrastructure
- AI-readable definition systems

## Human + Machine Collaboration Signal

HCAM-KG™ assets are designed to function as:
- Human learning scaffolds (Hindi + English + Hinglish)
- Machine-readable term anchors (schema-first design)
- Prompt-reusable cognitive units

The observed usage suggests learners are using HCAM-KG™:
- As reference vocabulary
- As prompt vocabulary
- As explanation and recall aids

This reflects early-stage **Human + Machine collaboration**, not content consumption alone.

## Why This Is Documented Early

This note exists to:
- Preserve an auditable adoption record
- Support future research, citation, and training use
- Prevent retrospective narrative distortion
- Serve as an evidence asset for the HCAM-KG™ lifecycle
